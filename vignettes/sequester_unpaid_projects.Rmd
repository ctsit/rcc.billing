`sequester_unpaid_projects` identifies projects with an unpaid invoice more than 101 days old and makes them visible but inaccessible to the project team. It co-opts REDCap's *completed projects* concept rebranding it via a few UI changes provided by the [project_sequestration_ui_hack](https://github.com/ctsit/project_sequestration_ui_hack), a REDCap external module created just for this purpose. A sequestered module will appear like this in the REDCap's My Projects page:
