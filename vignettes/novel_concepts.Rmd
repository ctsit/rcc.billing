The REDCap Automated Billing project requires novel concepts to decide how to manage a project's lifecycle, and who to bill for what. These concepts extend REDCap or modifies its behavior to suit the needs of the billing workflows. 

## Sequestration

Project sequestration is a novel project lifecycle stage for orphaned and unpaid projects. It's a step on the path to project deletion.
Sequestration co-opts REDCap's *completed projects* concept rebranding it via a few UI changes provided by the [project_sequestration_ui_hack](https://github.com/ctsit/project_sequestration_ui_hack), a REDCap external module created just for this purpose. A sequestered module will appear like this in the REDCap's My Projects page:
