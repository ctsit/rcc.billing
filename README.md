# REDCap Automated Billing

## Overview
REDCap Automated Billing is a automated, data-driven service billing system for a REDCap system. 

To turn our REDCap system from a cost center into a revenue generator and address the proliferation of orphaned REDCap projects, the University of Floridaâ€™s CTS-IT charges a modest annual fee for each project. To do this we created REDCap Automated Billing. It generates revenue, reduces data privacy risks by incentivizing the deletion of abandoned projects, and improves the quality of research productivity metrics. This requires us to improve our investigator and project metadata, partner with fiscal staff, and automate novel data workflows. 

## Motivation
- Generate revenue to offset costs and improve service.
- Reduce data exposure risk via deletion of unneeded things.
- Improve the quality of metrics by not counting junk projects.
- Reduce support staff workload.

## What we learned
- We can make money by charging for REDCap services.
- Charges are a tool to incentivize customer behavior.
- Good people data and project ownership data are required.
- There is no such thing as over-communication.
- Partner with your fiscal team.
- Use an incremental and iterative approach.
- Automate everything.
